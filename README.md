# ProducerConsumer

In this project, we implement a producer/consumer problem involving web scraping.

It inputs a list of URLs in the CSV, URLs.csv, and for each valid URL extracts all the hyperlinks in that URL.

Ensure that the .ipynb file, Producer-consumer test.ipynb, and the CSV are in the same directory.
